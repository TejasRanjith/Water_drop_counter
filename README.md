# pallathuli Peruvellam 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Banana Engineers

### Project Description
Pallathulli Peruvalam is a quirky Streamlit project that counts water droplets manually or from a video using OpenCV. With a soothing background and minimalist UI, it blends tech and humor to create the most beautifully useless tool ever. 💧✨

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
How many water droplets does it take to fill a glass?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built Pallathulli Peruvalam, a dramatically overengineered solution using Streamlit, OpenCV, and a moody aesthetic to count literal water droplets in real time.

Just upload a video of your IV drip—or better, watch them fall live—and we’ll tell you exactly how many droplets you've wasted contemplating life. All wrapped in a poetic UI that makes hydration feel... cinematic. 🎥💧✨

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Python – Core programming language
- OpenCV (cv2) – Video processing and computer vision
- NumPy – Array operations (implicitly via OpenCV)
- time – Built-in Python module for timing

For Hardware:
- 30–60 FPS Camera – e.g., smartphone or USB webcam
- Modified IV Dripper – Controlled drop release
- Collection Vessel – Standard cups or beakers
- Mounting Frame – Alignment and stability

🔄 Project Flow Description:
The system begins by accepting a video input through the Streamlit interface, typically showing an IV drip releasing water droplets. The uploaded video is processed using OpenCV, where each frame is analyzed in real time. Image preprocessing steps like grayscale conversion, blurring, and thresholding are applied to detect contours. These contours are filtered based on shape properties to identify actual droplets. For every valid detection, a droplet counter is incremented and displayed dynamically on the UI. Finally, the result — total droplets counted — is showcased with an aesthetic, interactive interface, all backed by the logic in the flowchart.
