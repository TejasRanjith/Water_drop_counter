# pallathuli Peruvellam üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Banana Engineers


### Team Members
- Member 1: Abina NJ - Jyothi Engineering College
- Member 2: Tejas Ranjith - Jyothi Engineering College

### Project Description
Pallathulli Peruvalam is a quirky Streamlit project that counts water droplets manually or from a video using OpenCV. With a soothing background and minimalist UI, it blends tech and humor to create the most beautifully useless tool ever. üíß‚ú®

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
How many water droplets does it take to fill a glass?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built Pallathulli Peruvalam, a dramatically overengineered solution using Streamlit, OpenCV, and a moody aesthetic to count literal water droplets in real time.

Just upload a video of your IV drip‚Äîor better, watch them fall live‚Äîand we‚Äôll tell you exactly how many droplets you've wasted contemplating life. All wrapped in a poetic UI that makes hydration feel... cinematic. üé•üíß‚ú®
